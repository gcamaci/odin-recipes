                <p>Panelle (Sicilian chickpea fritters) are a typical Sicilian street food. These crispy little bites made with chickpea flour are exceptionally delicious served in a panino and drizzled with fresh lemon juice. </p>

                    <li>Grease an 8-by-8 baking dish or a quarter sheet pan with some oil. Bring 2 cups water to a boil in a small saucepan. Put the chickpea flour in a large bowl. When the water comes to a boil, gradually add it to the bowl with the chickpea flour, whisking constantly to prevent lumps. Scrape the mixture into the saucepan you used to boil the water, sprinkle with salt and pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce to a gentle simmer, stir in 2 tablespoons of olive oil and cook for just a minute.</li>
                    <li>Scoop the chickpea mixture onto the sheet pan and spread it into an even layer. Let it cool, and cover loosely with parchment or plastic. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 24 hours.</li>
                    <li>Put at least 1/4 inch oil in a large skillet over medium heat; heat to 250. Cut the chickpea mixture into French fries, about 3 inches long; blot any excess moisture with a paper towel. Working in batches, gently drop them into the hot oil. Cook, rotating them occasionally until theyâ€™re golden all over, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain fries on paper towels and immediately sprinkle with salt and lots of pepper. Serve hot, with lemon wedges.</li>
